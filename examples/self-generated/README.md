# read-you - AI-powered README Generator

## Description
`read-you` is a Python-based tool that automatically generates README files for software repositories using AI. It analyzes the source code to identify key components and features, then crafts a comprehensive README file based on this analysis, utilizing OpenAI's capabilities.

## Installation Instructions
To install `read-you`, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can clone the repository and install the required dependencies as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/read-you.git
cd read-you
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to set up your OpenAI API key by creating a `secrets.yaml` file in the appropriate configuration directory as described in the code.

## Usage Examples
To generate a README for your repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python src/main.py <path_to_your_repository> [--model <model_name>] [--verbose] [--dry-run]
```

### Command-line Arguments:
- `repo_path`: Required. The path to the repository you want to analyze.
- `--model`: Optional. Specify the OpenAI model to use (default is configured in `secrets.yaml`).
